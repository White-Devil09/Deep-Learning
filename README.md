# Deep learning implementation

This repository contains some deep learning implementation using PyTorch.


## Notebooks

[Tenosrs.ipynb](https://github.com/White-Devil09/Deep-Learning/blob/master/Tenosrs.ipynb) : In this Notebook we come to know about basic tensor operations and conversion of numpy arrays to tensors.

[Linear_regression.ipynb](https://github.com/White-Devil09/Deep-Learning/blob/master/Linear_regression.ipynb) : In this Notebook we use LinearRegression to classify temp,rainfall, humidity vs crop yeild of apples and oranges.

[Logistic_regression.ipynb](https://github.com/White-Devil09/Deep-Learning/blob/master/Logistic_regression.ipynb) : In this Notebook we use LogisticRegression to classify MNIST dataset.

[Feed_forward_NN.ipynb](https://github.com/White-Devil09/Deep-Learning/blob/master/Feed_forward_NN.ipynb) : In this Notebook we use Feed_forward_NN to train model for MNIST dataset. We use Feed_forward_NN to overcome the linear relation that we tackled in LogisticRegression.


[Convolutional_neural_network.ipynb](https://github.com/White-Devil09/Deep-Learning/blob/master/Convolutional_neural_network.ipynb) : In this Notebook we use CNN to classify CIFAR10 dataset .

[ResNets.ipynb](https://github.com/White-Devil09/Deep-Learning/blob/master/ResNets.ipynb) : In this Notebook we implemented ResNet9 architecture to classify CIFAR10 data set as this contains residual blocks which helps to gain more accuracy than regular CNNs.

[GAN.ipynb](https://github.com/White-Devil09/Deep-Learning/blob/master/GAN.ipynb) : In this Notebook we generate anime faces from random noise. to run this Notebook please download [anime-faces](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/splcher/animefacedataset/download?datasetVersionNumber=3) dataset and place in folder 'data'.

[Transfer_learning.ipynb](https://github.com/White-Devil09/Deep-Learning/blob/master/Transfer_learning.ipynb) : In this Notebook we used pretrained ResNet34 model to train model instead of training from scartch.

[Fashion_MNIST.ipynb](https://github.com/White-Devil09/Deep-Learning/blob/master/Fashion_MNIST.ipynb) : In this Notebook we classified fashion mnist dataset.
